## Guidelines

### Touch (click) targets

* Target sizes should be increased on mobile; where feasible the functional target area can extend slightly beyond the visual target
* Target areas should be clearly delineated with borders and/or background coloring
* Multiple targets should be comfortably separated with margins and/or borders

### Tooltips

The small screens and touch interface of mobile devices tend to provide a poor experience for tooltips. A dialog should be used instead, with increased size and a large, clear "Close" button.

### Forms

* [`autocapitalize`](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/04/autocapitalize)
