## Links

Links should generally open in the same window. If the user is in a workflow that would be interrupted then links can open in a new window.

1. Always use [`rel="noopener noreferrer"`](https://www.jitbit.com/alexblog/256-targetblank---the-most-underestimated-vulnerability-ever/) with `target="_blank"`
1. Links that open a new window should include an indicator ([icon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/external-link-alt?style=solid))
