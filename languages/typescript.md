# TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means that all JS is valid TS. TS extends JS with type information.
Type information enables static analysis (performed by the TS compiler) to detect a number of bugs. It also helps
developers understand code more easily by communicating exactly what type of data is expected and acceptable.
Visual Studio Code displays type information which makes editing code easier.
