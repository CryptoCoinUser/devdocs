# CSS

You should understand how to use CSS to control a web page's presentation. If you already know CSS reasonably well, review the [MDN CSS reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference) and ensure you know how to use most of it.

If you need to learn CSS from scratch, refer to these resources:
