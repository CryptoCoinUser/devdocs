# JSON

Think of JSON like you think of PDF files. Have you ever coded a PDF file by hand? No! Don't write JSON either.

If your application needs object definitions, data models, schemas, etc. that need to be written by hand, use JavaScript modules. JSON is great for serialization, but serialization should be done with tools and libraries, not by hand.

Using JavaScript modules gives the added benefit of logic, inheritance, and code comments.
