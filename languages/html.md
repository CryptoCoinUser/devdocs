# HTML

You should be able to create a web page with a good understanding and use of available HTML elements. If you already know HTML reasonably well, review the [list of elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) and ensure you know how to use most of them.

If you need to learn HTML from scratch, refer to these resources:
