# GitHub

1. If you don't already have one, create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
1. Enable [two-factor authentication](https://github.com/blog/1614-two-factor-authentication)
1. GitHub's appearance can easily be customized with [Sylish](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish-custom-themes-for/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe). If you just want to change tab width from 8 to 4, you may find [this extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-size-on-github/ofjbgncegkdemndciafljngjbdpfmbkn) convenient. With Stylish more customization is easy. You can create a new style and use the following to customize to your preference:
```css
/* affects source code blocks */
.blob-code-inner,
.highlight {
	font-size: 16px;
	tab-size: 4;
}

/* affects all container blocks */
.container {
	width: 1200px;
}
```
