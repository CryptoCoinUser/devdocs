# Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) was developed to run JavaScript outside a web browser. It has since become a valuable development tool allowing JavaScript code to run on your workstation and perform build-related tasks like code preprocessing and minification.

You should typically install the LTS release of Node.js, and periodically update it. Updating Node.js will automatically update [npm](npm.md), the Node.js package manager, as well. You can also manually update npm at any time:

```shell
npm install -g npm
```

If you are not writing your own Node.js applications then you don't need to learn Node's API.
