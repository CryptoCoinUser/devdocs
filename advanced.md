## Enhancing your computing experience

* Make sure you are sitting comfortably with your screen at a good distance from you, and a good height.
* Screens emit light, which be wearing on your eyes. Using dark colors is more comfortable for some people. Many programs and web sites have theme or color options, so always look for them.

    1. Windows 10 has [Night light](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027563/windows-10-set-your-display-for-night-time)
    1. OS X has [Night Shift](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207513)
