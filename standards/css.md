# CSS coding standards

1. Avoid unnecessary quotes, use single quotes when quotes are necessary
1. Class names should be lowercase dasherized
1. One selector per line
1. Use [`hsl()/hsla()`](http://devdocs.io/css/color_value#hsla()) for colors
1. Use `normal/bold` (instead of 100, 400, 700, etc) for `font-weight`
	1. Exception: if you are using a specific font that supports more weights and you need to use one of them
