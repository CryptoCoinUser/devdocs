## Enhancing your computing experience

* Make sure you are sitting comfortably with your screen at a good distance from you, and a good height.
* Screens emit light, which be wearing on your eyes. Using dark colors is more comfortable for some people. Many programs and web sites have theme or color options (e.g. Gmail Settings->Themes), so always look for them.

### [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/)

[f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) reduces the amount of blue light emitted by your screen when it's dark out to reduce eyestrain and circadian rhythm disruption. It can be configured to varying intensity and can be configured to transition gradually. It's recommended to install f.lux at night, with your ambient light reduced. Install f.lux, then turn it all the way down. Give your eyes a minute or two to adjust, then slowly increase the brightness in f.lux until it looks nice.
